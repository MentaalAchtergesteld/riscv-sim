# RISC-V "Emulator"

A really simple, basic probably poorly written RISC-V "Emulator". Don't really know what would count as an emulator, it takes in RISC-V instructions and then (hopefully) executes them correctly.

## Implemented instructions:

- RV32I Base (mostly, no FENCE, environment calls or CSR)
- RV64I Base (Very little, just some to be able to run the test programs.)

## TODO:

- Add tests for new RV64I Base Instructions
